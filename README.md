# HCT-Net: A hybrid CNN-Transformer network for multi-class cervical cell classification

HCT-Net is a hybird deep learning model for automated classification of cervical cell images, combining the strengths of CNNs and Transformers to achieve superior performance in cervical cancer screening.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines CNN's local feature extraction with Transformer's global context modeling
- **Checkpoint System**: Automatic saving and resuming of training progress
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting and optimizes training time
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more
